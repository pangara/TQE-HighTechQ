# Coming Soon

An advanced workshop allows participants to gain a deeper understanding of the basic quantum computing concepts than an introductory workshop allows. In the introductory workshop, the basic quantum computing concepts include qubits, one- and two-qubit quantum systems,  superposition, gates, entanglement, quantum arithmetic rules, and the bra-ket notation.
