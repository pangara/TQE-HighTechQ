# Teaching quantum computing to high-school-aged youth: A hands-on approach


This repository contains some sample documents that have been used in delivering quantum computing workshops for high-school students. There are three different kinds of workshops offered: motivational, introductory, and advanced. Each of these workshops contains three different kinds of material as follows:
1. **Handouts**: Practice sheets and documents for setting up accounts with IBM.
2. **Notebooks**: Jupyter Notebooks to run Qiskit code. Includes exercises for students.
3. **Presentations**: Lectures that go hand in hand with handouts and notebooks.
